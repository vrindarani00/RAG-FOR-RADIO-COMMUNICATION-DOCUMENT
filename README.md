# RAG-FOR-RADIO-COMMUNICATION-DOCUMENT
A basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system fetches information from multiple documents. However, to enhance relevance, a ranking algorithm is employed, leveraging headings and subheadings. When a user query closely matches a document's heading or subheading, those results are prioritized higher following the RAG output.
